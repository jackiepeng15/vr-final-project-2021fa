You wake up in the middle of the night abandoned on a mysterious dock to the sound of a booming voice. Before you know it youâ€™re in a fight for your life. Zombies have risen from the dead and are attacking you from all sides. Luckily, a mysterious purple spirit is equipped with a variety of weapons and defense tools to help you survive. Still, it will be a challenge to defeat the undead swarm who seem to be spawning out of nowhere. Can you survive until the morning?

A Night on the Docks is a fast paced virtual reality game that puts you right in the middle of this dramatic tale. A perfect experience for someone new to VR, the game begins with an easy-to-follow, engaging tutorial that teaches you everything from how to teleport to how to detonate a grenade. From there, it is up to you to fight off the zombies and make it out alive.
